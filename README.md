# BinLock 🔒
BinLock is a cross-platform security tool designed to add password protection to executable files. It consists of two main components: `binguard` for protecting binaries and `launcher` for executing protected binaries.

## Features ✨

- Password protect any executable file
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Secure password verification
- Simple and straightforward usage
- Minimal performance impact

## Components 🛠️

### BinGuard
The protection utility that encrypts and secures your binary files.

### Launcher
The execution utility that runs protected binaries after password verification.

## Usage  💻

### Protecting a Binary

To protect an executable file using BinGuard:

binguard -i <input_binary> -o <output_binary> -pass <password>

Example:

binguard.exe -i .\Presentation.exe -o protected.exe -pass p@ssword

### Running a Protected Binary

To run a protected binary using Launcher:

launcher -ipf <protected_binary> -pass <password>

Example:

launcher.exe -ipf .\protected.exe -pass p@ssword

## Command Line Arguments

### BinGuard
- -i: Input binary path
- -o: Output binary path
- -pass: Password to protect the binary

### Launcher
- -ipf: Protected binary path
- -pass: Password to unlock and run the binary

## Security Considerations 🛡️

- Choose strong passwords
- Keep passwords secure and confidential
- BinLock is not a replacement for code signing or other security measures
- Protected binaries should be handled with the same security precautions as unprotected ones
